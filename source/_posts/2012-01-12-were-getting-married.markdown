Hello! Laura and I are gettin' hitched.  Our little romance has been going strong for nearly 5 years with no signs of slowing down any time soon.


Welcome to our blog. Here we will outline the process and details of our wedding, scheduled for the evening of August 25, 2012 at Valley Green Inn (Philadelphia, PA). 

More to information to come!
